      <h2>Data tells a lot but not the whole story.</h2>
      <p>Former music store employee law dictates that I make a top 10 albums list every year.</p>
      <p>By the end of a full year, I always seem to forget what was actually released that year, so I use my <a href="http://last.fm/user/janiejjones">last.fm</a> stats to jog my memory. This year, I thought it would be interesting to compare my top albums as recorded by last.fm with my personalized ranking.</p>
      <p>Last.fm got a me a good shortlist, but choosing favourites is another painstaking matter entirely. As expected, my list of 'best' varies significantly from what the numbers say.<p>

      <p>Why? I have a few theories.</p>

      <h3>Albums released earlier in the year had more time to be played</h3>
      <p>This probably explains why St. Vincent's <em>St. Vincent</em>(released Feb 25) came ahead to Caribou's <em>Our Love</em> (released Oct 25), which is undeniably my favourite album of the year. It would be interesting to do some sort of weighted play count based on time of year released, though there's other factors to take into account - like how long before an albums starts to fall out of my heavy rotation - and omg I'm not going down that rabbit hole.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>Album scrobbles are based on number of tracks played</h3>
      <p>Play count on an albums isn't how many times you've played the album in full, it's how many tracks from that album you've played. This explains why RÃ¶yksopp & Robyn's <em>Do It Again</em>, an EP with with 5 tracks, ranks so low on play count compared to favourite rank. Again, it might be interesting to normalize the counts based on number of tracks per album, but that's another task for another day.</p>
      <h3>Data is only as good as its collection method</h3>
      <p>The play count for ScHoolboy Q's <em>Oxymoron</em> was suspiciously low for how high it ranked on my list. A closer look showed my scrobbles for that album split between <em>Oxymoron</em> and <em>Oxymoron (Deluxe Edition)</em>, the latter a ghost album in last.fm's database that doesn't even have a release year on it. Music cataloging is hard.
      <p>There's also the possibility that I've listened to some of these albums somewhere that doesn't report to last.fm, eg. at a friend's house or on vinyl.</p>
      <h3>Data can't fully replace personal preference</h3>
      <p>While I'm fascinated by my own personal data and the <a href="http://www.theconnectivist.com/2013/07/how-google-tracks-traffic/">cool things</a> we can do with data, it's important to realize that it can't yet replace the nuances of human preference. That's probably why most music recommendation algorithms have failed me. I'm both picky and eclectic when it comes to music, and it's because my taste isn't easily defined by genres or characteristics - it's this nebulous, ill-defined idea of <em>what I like</em>.</p> <p>I'm a big fan of the digital world and I'd be cool with it if we eventually built an AI that could pin down my music taste, but until then I'll be deliberating over my top 10 list at the end of every year.</p>
