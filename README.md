#Top Albums of 2014 Chart

A D3 data vis of my top albums of 2014 ranked by last.fm play count vs. personal preference. 

##What is this?

I think data and data vis are cool, but also wanted to explore how data relates to human experience and preference. Read more about this on the [demo page](http://bren.zone/top10).

##How was it built?

Built with JavaScript, D3 and the last.fm API. Plus my old friend, Sass and new pals, Q, Gulp and Browserify.

A more details on the build in [this blog post.](http://brennaobrien.com/blog/2014/12/d3-last-fm-top-10-list.html)
